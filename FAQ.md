### 🤔: The OpenMoji Black or Colorfont is not working as expected ... is this me?

⚠️ The colorfont version of OpenMoji is in a very early alpha stage and not intended to use in production! Please follow the [discussion](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/issues/93) for updates.

### 🤔: Is there an "emoji popup" or "emoji picker" available for OpenMoji?

No, we are sorry! This is simply out of scope. But all other ways to consume/use/download OpenMojis are listed under [Downloads & Distribution Channels](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji#downloads--distribution-channels).

### 🤔: Does the OpenMoji project have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)?

No. OpenMoji does not have an explicit Contributor License Agreement. We simply go with common practice of many open source projects: "inbound = outbound"! Every Github user already agrees to this via the [terms of service](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license) of Github:

> Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms.

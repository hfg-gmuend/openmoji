## Contribution Guidelines for Non-Unicode Emojis

We don’t accept the following contributions as we have a limited amount of energy for moderation.

### ✅ Yes

- Anything which is defined in the Unicode Emoji standard
- Social and critical issues e.g. Climate change,
- [Unpleasant things](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/02/apple-replaces-gun-emoji-water-pistol-revolver-violence-debate) that are (unfortunately) part of reality – OpenMoji is more than just fun and smileys

### ❌ No

- Any kind of historical or official "military insignia" e.g. Swastika, German Army (Deutsches Heer), Royal Air Force, US Navy
- Flags of countries not recognized by the UN e.g. Taiwan
- Historic flags of states e.g. East Germany (Deutsche Demokratische Republik), Yugoslavia, Confederate States of America
- Religious images that are not in the Unicode standard or violate one of the above e.g. the Swastika is a religious symbol in Unicode but it violates the military insignia rules
- Any sexual or erotic imagery. Whille our “activity” emojis are depicted in their poses without clothes, the implication is not erotic.

### 🤔 With Discussion

- Well known non controversial fictional iconography e.g. [Star Trek’s United Federation of Planets](https://openmoji.org/library/#search=star trek&emoji=1F3F3-FE0F-200D-1F7E6-200D-1F30C)
- Symbols of movements or traditions e.g. [Remembrance Poppy](https://openmoji.org/library/#search=poppy&emoji=E002)



## OpenMoji Community Statement

OpenMoji is a community project interested in the creation of an open, independent and open-source emoji set.

### In practice

- We are not design or code snobs. We do not assume knowledge or imply there are things that somebody should know.
- We insist on actively engaging with requests for feedback regardless of their complexity.
- We welcome newcomers and prioritize the education of others. We strive to approach all tasks with the enthusiasm of a newcomer. Because we believe that newcomers are just as valuable in this effort as experts.
- We consistently make the effort to actively recognize and validate multiple types of contributions.
- We are always willing to offer help or guidance.
- We give everyone credits for their contributions.

### In times of conflict

- We listen.
- We clearly communicate while acknowledging other's feelings.
- We admit when we're wrong, apologize, and accept responsibility for our actions.
- We are continuously seeking to improve ourselves and our community.
- We keep our community respectful and open.
- We make everyone feel heard.
- We are mindful and kind in our interactions.

### Contribute

Our community is always looking for enthusiasts to help in all different ways.

- **Develop**.[ GitHub](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-library) is currently the main place where OpenMojis are collected, issues are documented, and discussions about the project are had. Check out the[ contributing documentation to get started](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) with developing new OpenMojis.
- **Document**. Everyone loves documentation. Help is needed to develop the styleguide further, creating more examples, adding documentation, and tutorials.
- **Teach**. Teach a workshop, a class, a friend, a collaborator! Tag[ #OpenMoji](https://twitter.com/search?q=OpenMoji) on Twitter and we will do our best to share what you're doing.
- **Create**. OpenMoji is looking for designers, artists, coders, programmers to bring your creative and amazing work to show and inspire other people. Submit your work to [OpenMojis in the Wild](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/issues/125) on Github.

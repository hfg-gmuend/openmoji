* Analysed, fixed and simplified all shape types for every emoji (e.g. removed mask shapes)

* Fixed every emoji to follow the OpenMoji color palette

* Added property contribution date (hfg_date) to the openmoji json/csv "data" files

* Fixed hour glasses to obey the laws of gravity


- Ditched .ai source files in favour of .svg! Yay!
